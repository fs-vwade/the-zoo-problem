# The Zoo Problem
A helpful way to guide the young interns as they begin their evolution from exhibit to expert in no time at all.

## Project Description
The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo recently hired many new zookeeper interns who will work at the zoo for the next six months. They have contracted your team to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors.
